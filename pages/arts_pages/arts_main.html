    <p class="sub-content">
    When a student chooses arts as a stream, it is thought that the options available are lower than those who take up science or commerce. Breaking this myth, arts career options have increased over time, and hence today, many individuals are making their names in prominent arts stream jobs.
    <br/>
    Many subjects one studies during their journey in arts include history, psychology, economics, political science, geography, philosophy, Hindi, and others. Studying these varied subjects helps explore arts stream jobs like law, journalism, hotel management, literature, and fashion designing, to name a few.
    <br/>
    These subjects in classes XI and XII work as a foundation for students to gain mastery later in their careers. Subjects like visual arts open the door to learning music, drama, and dance, whereas literature opens the door to specializing in languages and philosophy and corresponding arts stream jobs such as editing or proofreading. Arts is as challenging as any other stream and requires the correct mindset and aptitude to perform well, as these subjects help students to prepare for the Civil ServiceÂ Exams.
